Script Overview:
This Python script automates the scraping of product data from e-commerce product pages. 
It first validates the pages by checking for a "Product Overview" section, ensuring only valid product pages are processed. 
The script handles popups, retries failed attempts, and uses multi-threading for efficient scraping.

Features:
Product Validation: Validates if the page contains a "Product Overview" section.
Pop-up Handling: Automatically handles cookie and newsletter popups.
Error Handling: Retries failed attempts and logs errors for debugging.
Data Extraction: Scrapes product name, price, specifications, key features, FAQs, and images.
Multithreading: Uses threading for concurrent processing of multiple links.
Logging: Detailed logs of scraping actions, errors, and retries.
Output: Stores scraped data in a timestamped Excel file.

Benefits:
Efficiency: Fast and concurrent scraping using multiple threads.
Reliability: Only valid pages are scraped, and retries ensure data integrity.
Automation: Fully automated process, reducing manual effort.

Proxy:
The script supports proxy integration to handle IP-based restrictions and prevent scraping bans.
It routes requests through a set of proxy servers, allowing the script to bypass rate limits and geo-blocks, ensuring uninterrupted data collection. 
Proxies are configured and used for each request, enhancing anonymity and reducing the risk of IP blocking during the scraping process.
