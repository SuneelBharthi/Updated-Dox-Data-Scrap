The script begins by importing necessary libraries like Selenium, Pandas, and BeautifulSoup, and sets up logging to capture the scraping process. It loads already scraped product URLs to avoid duplication and reads a list of new product links from an Excel file. The Chrome browser is launched using Selenium WebDriver in maximized mode. For each product URL, the script navigates to the page, waits for essential elements to load, and extracts product details including the name, MPN, current and list price, category breadcrumbs, and tags. It attempts to click and scrape the specifications table, fetches key features, and collects FAQs using both Selenium and BeautifulSoup. It also downloads up to four valid product images, naming them according to the MPN and image type. 

Data Extracted:
	Product Name & MPN – Captures the product title and manufacturer part number.
	Pricing Information – Extracts the current and listed prices with VAT adjustments.
	Breadcrumb Navigation – Retrieves the sub-category, child category, and grandchild categories to classify the product.
	Tags – Gathers highlighted product tags such as "Bestseller" or "Clearance".
	Key Features – Lists prominent product highlights from the UI.
	Specifications – Dynamically expands and parses all specification tables, converting them into a structured JSON format.
	FAQs – Extracts frequently asked questions and answers from the product page.
	Images – Downloads up to four valid product images (ignoring videos or unsupported formats) and names them in a consistent format:
	MPN-price.jpg (Thumbnail)
	MPN-1-price.jpg, MPN-2-price.jpg, etc. (Additional Images)

Output:
All scraped information is compiled into a structured Excel file, and product images are stored locally in a product_images/ folder. The Excel file is named dynamically based on the current timestamp to ensure uniqueness.

Additional Features:
Robust error handling and logging
Visibility checks and dynamic waits for reliable element loading
JSON formatting for specs, tags, key features, and FAQs for easy integration into downstream systems.
Web Scraped product details, from (https://box.co.uk/acer-swift-laptops), Scraping Product Data:
This script is a multi-threaded Selenium-based web scraper designed to extract detailed product information from Box.co.uk. 
It reads product URLs from an Excel file, handles popups, and scrapes key data. The script uses retry logic to reattempt failed scrapes and logs all activity. Final results and any failed links are saved in Excel files for review.
