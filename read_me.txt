Tags â€“ Gathers highlighted product tags such as "Bestseller" or "Clearance".

Key Features â€“ Lists prominent product highlights from the UI.

Specifications â€“ Dynamically expands and parses all specification tables, converting them into a structured JSON format.

FAQs â€“ Extracts frequently asked questions and answers from the product page.

Images â€“ Downloads up to four valid product images (ignoring videos or unsupported formats) and names them in a consistent format:

MPN-price.jpg (Thumbnail)

MPN-1-price.jpg, MPN-2-price.jpg, etc. (Additional Images)

ðŸ’¾ Output:
